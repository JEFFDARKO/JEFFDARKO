# 🎖️ Hey, I'm Weirdo - The Code-Obsessed Oddity 🎖️  

**Yep!, my name is Weirdo 🤪**, and I'm here too prove that being a little _weird_ is actually pretty awesome 🚀. I am a robotics 🤖 geeks, I like write ✍️ a lot during my leisure time, and I have been known to have deep philosophical conversations with my computer when it refuses to cooperate 💻🤯. I am all about embracing the weirdness and making it work.
Here are a few things that make me weirdly awesome:

+ I talk to my code like it can hear me 🥶💻
+ I drink way too much coffee and still find myself falling asleep during meetings ☕😴
+ I have an unhealthy obsession with collecting stickers, and yes, they’re all over my laptop 💻🎨
+ I code at weird hours, because inspiration strikes at 3 AM 🌙💡
+ I have a collection of weird error messages 🧐 – Don’t ask how, don’t ask why. It just happens.
+ ever afraid to get a little weird with my hardware – From Raspberry Pi 🧩 projects to building robots that might be smarter than me (they’re coming for us all) 🤖.

Let’s embrace the weirdness together, shall we? 🤪
