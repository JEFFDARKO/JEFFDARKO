**Yep!, my name is Weirdo 🤪**, and I'm here too prove that being a little   _weird_ is actually pretty awesome 🚀. I am a robotics 🤖 geeks, I like write ✍️ a lot during my leisure time, and I have been known to have deep philosophical conversations with my computer when it refuses to cooperate 💻🤯. I am all about embracing the weirdness and making it work.

<!-- h2 header would be too big for me that's why I opted for 5#s -->
##### Here are a few things that make me weirdly awesome

+ I talk to my code like it can hear me 🥶💻
+ I drink way too much coffee and still find myself falling asleep during meetings ☕😴
+ I have an unhealthy obsession with collecting stickers, and yes, they’re all over my laptop 💻🎨
+ I code at weird hours, because inspiration strikes at 3 AM 🌙💡
+ I have a collection of weird error messages 🧐 – Don’t ask how, don’t ask why. It just happens.
+ Projects: Too weird to explain, but awesome!  🤖

Let’s embrace the weirdness together, shall we? 🤪
